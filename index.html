			<H1>Dr. Maribel Montañez-Juan</H1>
			<H2>PhD in Human Resources Psychology</H2>
			<p>I am a Lecturer and researcher in Work and Organizational Psychology at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). I hold a PhD in Human Resources Psychology from the University of Valencia, and I am a principal member of the I+RhETOS consolidated research group. My academic work focuses on sustainable well-being at work, decent employment, and the challenges and opportunities brought by digitalization in organizational contexts. These lines of inquiry are closely aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those related to quality education, gender equality in digital contexts, and decent work for all. I have contributed to several nationally and regionally funded R&D projects on psychosocial risks, digital transformation, and psychological health in the workplace. My scientific output includes peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, and conference presentations at major events such as EAWOP, IAAP, and SCEPS. I have also completed an international research stay at ISCTE-IUL (Lisbon), collaborating on a project related to digital skills and sustainable leadership. Beyond academia, I have worked with public and private organizations to translate scientific knowledge into practical workplace improvements and public policy. I actively engage in science communication and education outreach, leading workshops, talks, and school-based initiatives to foster critical thinking and well-being. My career is driven by a commitment to interdisciplinary, socially engaged, and methodologically rigorous research, with the aim of promoting healthier, fairer, and more meaningful work experiences. </p>
